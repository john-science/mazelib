*Click to see Aldous Broder in Action*](images/aldous_broder_7x7.gif?raw=true)

###### The Algorithm

1. Choose a random cell.
2. Choose a random neighbor of the current cell and visit it. If the neighbor has not yet been visited, add the traveled edge to the spanning tree.
3. Repeat step 2 until all cells have been visited.

###### Results

perfect, unbiased

###### Notes

This algorithm treats the cells of a maze as a graph, and solves to find a Uniform Spanning Tree that covers that graph. Like most tree-based maze algorithms, this one is a little slow.


## Backtracking Generator

[![Click to see the Backtracking Generator in Action](images/backtracking_7x7.png?raw=true)
*Click to see the Backtracking Generator in Action*](images/backtracking_7x7.gif?raw=true)

###### The Algorithm

1. Randomly choose a starting cell.
2. Randomly choose a wall at the current cell and open a passage through it to any random, unvisited, adjacent cell. This is now the current cell.
3. If all adjacent cells have been visited, back up to the previous and repeat step 2.
4. Stop when the algorithm has backed all the way up to the starting cell.

###### Results

perfect

###### Notes

This is perhaps the most common maze-generation algorithm because it is easy to understand and implement. And it produces high-quality mazes.


## Binary Tree

[![Click to see the Binary Tree in Action](images/binary_tree_7x7.png?raw=true)
*Click to see the Binary Tree in Action*](images/binary_tree_7x7.gif?raw=true)

###### The Algorithm

1. For every cell in the grid, knock down a wall either North or West.

###### Optional Parameters

* *skew*: String {'NW', 'NE', 'SE', 'SW'}
 * Determines which corner of the maze to start looping from. Thus, it also determines the direction of the skew inherant in this algorithm. (default 'NW')

###### Results

perfect, biased, skewed

###### Notes

This algorithm produces mazes with a serious flaw: the North and West borders of the maze are completely open. Generally, this makes solving the maze too easy to be fun. However, if the person solving the maze can't see the entire thing at one time, this algorithm is still useful.

On the positive side, this algorithm is extremely fast and very easy to implement.


## Cellular Automaton

[![Click to see the Cellular Automaton in Action](images/cell_auto_7x7.png?raw=true)
*Click to see the Cellular Automaton in Action*](images/cell_auto_7x7.gif?raw=true)

###### The Algorithm

Cells survive if they have one to three neighbours. If a cell has exactly three neighbours, it is born. It is similar to Conway's Game of Life, but adapted to fix the rules of maze walls.

###### Optional Parameters

* *comlpexity*: Float [0.0, 1.0]
 * Determines the number of times to seed from a given cell. (default 1.0)
* *density*: Float [0.0, 1.0]
 * Determines how many cells to seed from. (default 1.0)

###### Results

imperfect, slightly biased

###### Notes

Using Cellular Automation to generate a maze is a really fun idea, but it is definitely the slowest maze-generating algorithm. The algorithm does not guarantee a "perfect" maze. In fact, mazes generated like this have all kinds of strange and unique problems. That, if you are a maze purist, you will hate. But if you are trying to make mazes hard to solve you might find interesting.


## Dungeon Rooms

[![Click to see Dungeon Rooms in Action](images/dungeon_rooms_11x11.png?raw=true)
*Click to see Dungeon Rooms in Action*](images/dungeon_rooms_11x11.gif?raw=true)

###### The Algorithm

This is a variation on Hunt-and-Kill where the initial maze has rooms carved out of it, instead of being completely filled.

###### Optional Parameters

* *rooms*: List(List(tuple, tuple))
 * A list of lists, containing the top-left and bottom-right grid coords of where you want rooms to be created. For best results, the corners of each room should have odd-numbered coordinates.
* *grid*: 2D Numpy Array, filled with booleans, all set to `True`, OR with a valid maze inside
 * A pre-built maze array filled with one, or many, rooms.
* *hunt_order*: String ['random', 'serpentine']
 * Determines how the next cell to hunt from will be chosen. (default 'random')

###### Results

imperfect, slightly biased

###### Notes

Theseus traversed a maze to find a minotaur in the center. Similar things happen in a lot of games; players will traverse a maze to find a room filled with enemies or treasure. I developed this algorithm to aid this use-case.


## Eller's

[![Click to see the Eller's in Action](images/ellers_7x7.png?raw=true)
*Click to see the Eller's in Action*](images/ellers_7x7.gif?raw=true)

###### The Algorithm

1. Put the each cell of the first row in its own set.
2. Join adjacent cells. But not if they are already in the same set. Merge the sets of these cells.
3. For each set in the row, create at least one vertical connection down to the next row.
4. Put any unconnected cells in the next row into their own set.
5. Repeat steps 2 through 4 until the last row.
6. In the last row, join all adjacent cells that do not share a set.

###### Optional Parameters

* *xskew*: Float [0.0, 1.0]
 * Probability of joining cells in the same row. (default 0.5)
* *yskew*: Float [0.0, 1.0]
 * Probability of joining cells in the same column. (default 0.5)

###### Results

perfect

###### Notes

This is a classic set-theory algorithm. It is not the fastest algorithm, as it requires relabeling whole sets of cells at every step.


## Growing Tree

[![Click to see the Growing Tree in Action](images/growing_tree_7x7.png?raw=true)
*Click to see the Growing Tree in Action*](images/growing_tree_7x7.gif?raw=true)

###### The Algorithm

1. Let C be a list of cells, initially empty. Add one a random cell from the maze to C.
2. Choose a cell from C, and carve a passage to any unvisited neighbor of that cell, adding that neighbor to C as well. If there are no unvisited neighbors, remove the cell from C.
3. Repeat step 2 until C is empty.

###### Optional Parameters

* *backtrack_chance*: Float [0.0, 1.0]
 *  Splits the logic to either use Recursive Backtracking (RB) or Prim's (random) to select the next cell to visit. (default 1.0)

###### Results

perfect

###### Notes

This algorithm is very flexible. Instead of defining exactly what must be done, it lays out a general construct. The exact order in which we choose a new cell from set C in step 2 is left undefined. That means we can pick one at random (and mimic the Prim's algorithm), or always pick the most recent one (and mimic the Backtracking algorithm). This implementation allows the developer to set the percentage of time Backtracking is chosen versus Prim's. This gives a lot of variety to the final complexity and look of the final maze.


## Hunt-and-Kill

[![Click to see Hunt-and-Kill in Action](images/huntandkill_7x7.png?raw=true)
*Click to see Hunt-and-Kill in Action*](images/huntandkill_7x7.gif?raw=true)

###### The Algorithm

1. Randomly choose a starting cell.
2. Perform a random walk from the current cell, carving passages to unvisited neighbors, until the current cell has no unvisited neighbors.
3. Select a new grid cell; if it has been visited, walk from it.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 a sufficient number of times that there the probability of a cell not being visited is extremely small.

###### Optional Parameters

* *hunt_order*: String ['random', 'serpentine']
 * Determines how the next cell to hunt from will be chosen. (default 'random')

###### Results

perfect

###### Notes

Generally, you might think random-walk algorithms are very slow. But Hunt-and-Kill is quite efficient. And I really like the end results of this algorithm: the mazes are not easy to solve.

In this implementation of Hunt-and-kill there are two different ways to select a new grid cell in step 2. The first is serpentine through the grid (the classic solution), the second is to randomly select a new cell enough times that the probability of an unexplored cell is very, very low. The second option includes a small amount of risk, but it creates a more interesting, harder maze. Thus, the second option is default in this implementation.


## Kruskal's

[![Click to see the Kruskal's in Action](images/kruskal_7x7.png?raw=true)
*Click to see the Kruskal's in Action*](images/kruskal_7x7.gif?raw=true)

###### The Algorithm

1. Create a set of all walls in the grid.
2. Randomly select a wall from the grid. If that wall connects two disjoint trees, join the trees. Otherwise, remove that wall from the set.
3. Repeat step 2 until there are no more walls left in the set.

###### Results

perfect

###### Notes

Like Prim's, it is based on a namesake algorithm for finding a Minimal Spanning Tree (MST) over a graph.


## Prim's

[![Click to see the Prim's in Action](images/prims_7x7.png?raw=true)
*Click to see the Prim's in Action*](images/prims_7x7.gif?raw=true)

###### The Algorithm

1. Choose an arbitrary cell from the grid, and add it to some (initially empty) set visited nodes (V).
2. Randomly select a wall from the grid that connects a cell in V with another cell not in V.
3. Add that wall to the Minimal Spanning Tree (MST), and the edge’s other cell to V.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until V includes every cell in G.

###### Results

perfect

###### Notes

This is a classic. Like Kruskal's, it is based on the idea of finding a MST in a graph. But Prim's is purely random. In fact, randomized variations on other maze-generating algorithms are frequently called "Prim's variations".


## Recursive Division

[![Click to see the Division in Action](images/division_7x7.png?raw=true)
*Click to see the Division in Action*](images/division_7x7.gif?raw=true)

###### The Algorithm

1. Start with an empty grid.
2. Build a wall that bisects the grid (horizontal or vertical). Add a single passage through the wall.
3. Repeat step 2 with the areas on either side of the wall.
4. Continue, recursively, until the maze passages are the desired resolution.

###### Results

perfect, biased, skewed

###### Notes

The algorithm is very simple to understand, and reasonably simple to implement. But the results will always look skewed. A big line that perfect divides a maze makes it easier for the human eye to solve: it reduces your visual search space. This is doubly true for humans that happen to know the maze was created by division.

This implementation tries, as far as is possible, to reduce this skew by alternating the cuts between horizontal and vertical. (Obviously, if you made 7 vertical cuts in a row the maze would be very easy to solve.)


## Sidewinder

[![Click to see the Sidewinder in Action](images/sidewinder_7x7.png?raw=true)
*Click to see the Sidewinder in Action*](images/sidewinder_7x7.gif?raw=true)

###### The Algorithm

1. Select cells in the maze, row-by-row.
2. Add the current cell to a “run” set.
3. For the current cell, randomly decide whether to carve East.
4. If a passage East was carved, make the new cell the current cell and repeat steps 2-4.
5. If a passage East was not carved, choose any one of the cells in the run set and carve a passage North. Then empty the run set. Repeat steps 2-5.
6. Continue until all rows have been processed.

###### Optional Parameters

* *skew*: Float [0.0, 1.0]
 * If the skew is set less than 0.5 the maze will be skewed East-West, if it set greater than 0.5 it will be skewed North-South. (default 0.5)

###### Results

perfect, flawed

###### Notes

The algorithm is simple and optimally fast. However, the North side of the maze will always be one, long, open corridor. For my tastes, this makes the maze too easy to solve. There are use-cases where that will not matter though; if the person solving the maze cannot see the whole thing at one time.

Research is needed to create a post-processing step to fix this flaw.  (Though that will mean varrying from the original algorithm.)


## Wilson's

[![Click to see the Wilson's in Action](images/wilsons_7x7.png?raw=true)
*Click to see the Wilson's in Action*](images/wilsons_7x7.gif?raw=true)

###### The Algorithm

1. Choose a random cell and add it to the Uniform Spanning Tree (UST).
2. Select any cell that is not in the UST and perform a random walk until you find a cell that is.
3. Add the cells and walls visited in the random walk to the UST.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until all cells have been added to the UST.

###### Optional Parameters

* *hunt_order*: String ['random', 'serpentine']
 * Determines how the next cell to hunt from will be chosen. (default 'random')

###### Results

perfect, unbiased

###### Notes

Like all random-walk algorithms, Wilson's isn't terribly fast. However, this still converges faster than Aldous-Broder. And it produces similarly nice results.
