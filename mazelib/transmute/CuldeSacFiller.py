    The Cul-de-Sac Filler maze transmutation algorithm.

    This algorithm could be called LoopFiller, because it breaks up loop in the maze.

    1. Scan the maze, looking for cells with connecting halls that go in exactly two directions.
    2. At each of these places, travel in both directions until you find your first intersection.
    3. If the first intersection for both paths is the same, you have a loop.
    4. Fill in the cell you started at with a wall, breaking the loop.
