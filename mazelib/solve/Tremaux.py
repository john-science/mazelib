    The Tremaux maze solving algorithm.

    0. Every time you visit a cell, mark it once.
    1. When you hit a dead end, turn around and go back.
    2. When you hit a junction you haven't visited, pick a new passage at random.
    3. If you're walking down a new passage and hit a junction you have visited,
        treat it like a dead end and go back.
    4. If walking down a passage you have visited before (i.e. marked once) and you hit a junction,
        take any new passage available, otherwise take an old passage (i.e. marked once).
    5. When you finally reach the end, follow cells marked exactly once back to the start.
    6. If the Maze has no solution, you'll find yourself at the start with all cells marked twice.

    Results

    Finds one non-optimal solution.
    Works against imperfect mazes.
