    The Hunt-and-Kill maze-generating algorithm.

    1. Randomly choose a starting cell.
    2. Perform a random walk from the current cel, carving passages to unvisited neighbors,
       until the current cell has no unvisited neighbors.
    3. Select a new grid cell; if it has been visited, walk from it.
    4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 a sufficient number of times that there the probability of a cell
       not being visited is extremely small.

    In this implementation of Hunt-and-kill there are two different ways to select a new grid cell in step 2.  The first
    is serpentine through the grid (the classic solution), the second is to randomly select a new cell enough times that
    the probability of an unexplored cell is very, very low. The second option includes a small amount of risk, but it
    creates a more interesting, harder maze.
