    The Growing-Tree maze-generating algorithm.

    1. Let C be a list of cells, initially empty. Add one cell to C, at random.
    2. Choose a cell from C, and carve a passage to any unvisited neighbor of that cell,
        adding that neighbor to C as well. If there are no unvisited neighbors,
        remove the cell from C.
    3. Repeat step 2 until C is empty.

        Splits the logic to either use Recursive Backtracking (RB) or Prim's (random)
