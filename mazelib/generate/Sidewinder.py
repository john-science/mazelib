    1. Work through the grid row-wise, starting with the cell at 0,0.
    2. Add the current cell to a "run" set.
    3. For the current cell, randomly decide whether to carve East.
    4. If a passage East was carved, make the new cell the current cell and repeat steps 2-4.
    5. If a passage East was not carved, choose any one of the cells in the run set and carve
        a passage North. Then empty the run set. Repeat steps 2-5.
    6. Continue until all rows have been processed.

    Optional Parameters

    skew: Float [0.0, 1.0]
        If the skew is set less than 0.5 the maze will be skewed East-West, if it set greater
        than 0.5 it will be skewed North-South. (default 0.5)
